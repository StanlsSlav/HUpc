## Inspiration
first of all, we had no idea what to do, we were a bit lost with the challenges, since there are many to choose from and they are all very different things, but in the end we ended up deciding to make this game, when reading the description of one of the challenges, Capchase, where it was talked about as a kind of drawing race, then we weighed, in a race against the clock, to draw the drawing that they give us, in the fastest and most perfect way possible.

## What it does
We replicate the image, with a very short time of 15 seconds, forcing ourselves to go with the maximum speed that we can, it seems easy, but it costs a lot.

## How we built it
We have done it using python, which we have been learning by programming, since we never used it before.

## Challenges we ran into
Since it was a language that we do not know, perhaps the biggest challenge was starting from almost 0 to learn, we even had some problem when installing it. And with the part of the graphical interface, we had some other problem, especially with the texts.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the result we have had, and of being able to finish this demo, even without knowing python beforehand.

## What we learned
We have learned a lot about python, and many of what we can do when learning a new language to create a project in 36 hours between 2 people.

## What's next for PIXEL-RUN
we would like, when we have just learned a little more about pyhon, that it will end, and also be able to implement a daily ranking that is updated live.
